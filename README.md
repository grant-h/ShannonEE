# ShannonEE


A dynamic analysis environment for Samsung's Shannon baseband.
See https://github.com/grant-h/ShannonBaseband for tools on reverse engineering Shannon firmware.

**Important Note:** ShannonEE has been extended and renamed to "FirmWire". It now also supports analysis for MediaTek based firmware images. You can find source code, documentation, and a scientific paper about it in the [FirmWire Github Repository](https://github.com/FirmWire/FirmWire)
